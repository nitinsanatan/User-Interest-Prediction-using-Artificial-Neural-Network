# User-Interest-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network

The main motive of this project is to use ANN techniques and predict several trends based on
the reviews posted on holidayiq.com. We have Buddy move dataset which contains the
numbers of reviews information in every category. 

We need to predict the number of reviews given in a category based on reviews given on other
categories. We are mainly focused upon classifying the user interests based on number of
reviews published by them on the website.
In ANN, I have used Perceptron, Backpropagation, Support Vector Machine, Self-Organizing
Maps and Linear Vector Quantization for training my data.
